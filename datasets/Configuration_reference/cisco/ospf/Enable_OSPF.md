# Enable OSPF

This task explains how to perform the minimum OSPF configuration on your router that is to enable an OSPF process with a router ID, configure a backbone or nonbackbone area, and then assign one or more interfaces on which OSPF runs.

## Before you begin

Although you can configure OSPF before you configure an IP address, no OSPF routing occurs until at least one IP address is configured.

## SUMMARY STEPS

1. `configure`
2. Do one of the following:
   - `router ospf process-name`
   - `router ospfv3 process-name`
3. `router-id { router-id }`
4. `area area-id`
5. `interface type interface-path-id`
6. Repeat Step 5 for each interface that uses OSPF.
7. `log adjacency changes [ detail ] [ enable | disable ]`
8. Use the `commit` or `end` command.

## DETAILED STEPS

### Step 1

```bash
configure
```

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# configure
```

Enters mode.

### Step 2

Do one of the following:
- `router ospf process-name`
- `router ospfv3 process-name`

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)# router ospf 1
```

or

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)# router ospfv3 1
```

Enables OSPF routing for the specified routing process and places the router in router configuration mode.

or

Enables OSPFv3 routing for the specified routing process and places the router in router ospfv3 configuration mode.

The `process-name` argument is any alphanumeric string no longer than 40 characters.

**Note:**

### Step 3

```bash
router-id { router-id }
```

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-ospf)# router-id 192.168.4.3
```

Configures a router ID for the OSPF process.

We recommend using a stable IP address as the router ID.

**Note:**

### Step 4

```bash
area area-id
```

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-ospf)# area 0
```

Enters area configuration mode and configures an area for the OSPF process.

- Backbone areas have an area ID of 0.
- Nonbackbone areas have a nonzero area ID.
- The `area-id` argument can be entered in dotted-decimal or IPv4 address notation, such as `area 1000` or `area 0.0.3.232`. However, you must choose one form or the other for an area. We recommend using the IPv4 address notation.

### Step 5

```bash
interface type interface-path-id
```

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-ospf-ar)# interface TenGigE 0/1/0/3
```

Enters interface configuration mode and associates one or more interfaces for the area configured in Step 4.

### Step 6

Repeat Step 5 for each interface that uses OSPF.

### Step 7

```bash
log adjacency changes [ detail ] [ enable | disable ]
```

**Example:**

```bash
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-ospf-ar-if)# log adjacency changes detail
```

(Optional) Requests notification of neighbor changes.

- By default, this feature is enabled.
- The messages generated by neighbor changes are considered notifications, which are categorized as severity Level 5 in the `logging console` command. The `logging console` command controls which severity level of messages are sent to the console. By default, all severity level messages are sent.

### Step 8

Use the `commit` or `end` command.

- `commit` — Saves the configuration changes and remains within the configuration session.
- `end` — Prompts user to take one of these actions:
  - `Yes` — Saves configuration changes and exits the configuration session.
  - `No` — Exits the configuration session without committing the configuration changes.
  - `Cancel` — Remains in the configuration session, without committing the configuration changes.

## Enable OSPF: Example

OSPF areas must be explicitly configured, and interfaces configured under the area configuration mode are explicitly bound to that area. In this example, interface `10.1.2.0/24` is bound to area 0 and interface `10.1.3.0/24` is bound to area 1.

```bash
interface TenGigE 0/3/0/0
 ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.0
 negotiation auto
!
interface TenGigE 0/3/0/1
 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255.0
 negotiation auto
!
router ospf 1
 router-id 10.2.3.4
 area 0
  interface TenGigE 0/3/0/0
 !
 area 1
  interface TenGigE 0/3/0/1
 !
!
```
```
