# Prerequisites for Configuring IRB

You must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes the proper task IDs. The command reference guides include the task IDs required for each command. If you suspect user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance.

Before configuring IRB, be sure that these tasks and conditions are met:

- Know the IP addressing and other Layer 3 information to be configured on the bridge virtual interface (BVI).
- Complete MAC address planning if you decide to override the common global MAC address for all BVIs.
- Be sure that the BVI network address is being advertised by running static or dynamic routing on the BVI interface.
