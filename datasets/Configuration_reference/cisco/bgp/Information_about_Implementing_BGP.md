# Information about Implementing BGP

To implement BGP, you need to understand the following concepts:

## BGP Router Identifier

For BGP sessions between neighbors to be established, BGP must be assigned a router ID. The router ID is sent to BGP peers in the OPEN message when a BGP session is established.

BGP attempts to obtain a router ID in the following ways (in order of preference):

- By means of the address configured using the `bgp router-id` command in router configuration mode.
- By using the highest IPv4 address on a loopback interface in the system if the router is booted with saved loopback address configuration.
- By using the primary IPv4 address of the first loopback address that gets configured if there are not any in the saved configuration.

If none of these methods for obtaining a router ID succeeds, BGP does not have a router ID and cannot establish any peering sessions with BGP neighbors. In such an instance, an error message is entered in the system log, and the `show bgp summary` command displays a router ID of `0.0.0.0`. After BGP has obtained a router ID, it continues to use it even if a better router ID becomes available. This usage avoids unnecessary flapping for all BGP sessions. However, if the router ID currently in use becomes invalid (because the interface goes down or its configuration is changed), BGP selects a new router ID (using the rules described) and all established peering sessions are reset.

We strongly recommend that the `bgp router-id` command is configured to prevent unnecessary changes to the router ID (and consequent flapping of BGP sessions).

## BGP Default Limits

BGP imposes maximum limits on the number of neighbors that can be configured on the router and on the maximum number of prefixes that are accepted from a peer for a given address family. This limitation safeguards the router from resource depletion caused by misconfiguration, either locally or on the remote neighbor. The following limits apply to BGP configurations:

- The default maximum number of peers that can be configured is 100. The default can be changed using the `bgp maximum neighbor` command. Any attempt to configure additional peers beyond the maximum limit or set the maximum limit to a number that is less than the number of peers currently configured will fail.
- To prevent a peer from flooding BGP with advertisements, a limit is placed on the number of prefixes that are accepted from a peer for each supported address family. The default limits can be overridden through configuration of the `maximum-prefix limit` command for the peer for the appropriate address family. The following default limits are used if the user does not configure the maximum number of prefixes for the address family:
  - IPv4 prefixes: 128K
  - IPv6 Prefixes: 64K

A cease notification message is sent to the neighbor and the peering with the neighbor is terminated when the number of prefixes received from the peer for a given address family exceeds the maximum limit (either set by default or configured by the user) for that address family.

It is possible that the maximum number of prefixes for a neighbor for a given address family has been configured after the peering with the neighbor has been established and a certain number of prefixes have already been received from the neighbor for that address family. A cease notification message is sent to the neighbor and peering with the neighbor is terminated immediately after the configuration if the configured maximum number of prefixes is fewer than the number of prefixes that have already been received from the neighbor for the address family.

## BGP Attributes and Operators

## BGP Best Path Algorithm

BGP routers typically receive multiple paths to the same destination. The BGP best-path algorithm determines the best path to install in the IP routing table and to use for forwarding traffic. This section describes the Cisco IOS XR software implementation of BGP best-path algorithm, as specified in Section 9.1 of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Network Working Group draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-24.txt document.

The BGP best-path algorithm implementation is in three parts:

1. **Part 1**—Compares two paths to determine which is better.
2. **Part 2**—Iterates over all paths and determines which order to compare the paths to select the overall best path.
3. **Part 3**—Determines whether the old and new best paths differ enough so that the new best path should be used.

### Comparing Pairs of Paths

Perform the following steps to compare two paths and determine the better path:

1. If either path is invalid (for example, a path has the maximum possible MED value or it has an unreachable next hop), then the other path is chosen (provided that the path is valid).
2. If the paths have unequal pre-bestpath cost communities, the path with the lower pre-bestpath cost community is selected as the best path.
3. If the paths have unequal weights, the path with the highest weight is chosen.
4. If the paths have unequal local preferences, the path with the higher local preference is chosen.
5. If one of the paths is a redistributed path, which results from a redistribute or network command, then it is chosen. Otherwise, if one of the paths is a locally generated aggregate, which results from an aggregate-address command, it is chosen.
6. If the paths have unequal AS path lengths, the path with the shorter AS path is chosen. This step is skipped if `bgp bestpath as-path ignore` command is configured.
7. If the paths have different origins, the path with the lower origin is selected. Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is considered lower than EGP, which is considered lower than INCOMPLETE.
8. If appropriate, the MED of the paths is compared. If they are unequal, the path with the lower MED is chosen.
9. If one path is received from an external peer and the other is received from an internal (or confederation) peer, the path from the external peer is chosen.
10. If the paths have different IGP metrics to their next hops, the path with the lower IGP metric is chosen.
11. If the paths have unequal IP cost communities, the path with the lower IP cost community is selected as the best path.
12. If all path parameters in Step 1 through Step 10 are the same, then the router IDs are compared.
13. If the paths have different cluster lengths, the path with the shorter cluster length is selected.
14. Finally, the path received from the neighbor with the lower IP address is chosen.

## BGP Update Message Error Handling

The BGP UPDATE message error handling changes BGP behavior in handling error UPDATE messages to avoid session reset. Based on the approach described in IETF IDR I-D:draft-ietf-idr-error-handling, the Cisco IOS XR BGP UPDATE Message Error handling implementation classifies BGP update errors into various categories based on factors such as, severity, likelihood of occurrence of UPDATE errors, or type of attributes.

### BGP Error Handling and Attribute Filtering Syslog Messages

When a router receives a malformed update packet, an ios_msg of type `ROUTING-BGP-3-MALFORM_UPDATE` is printed on the console. This is rate limited to 1 message per minute across all neighbors.

Sample error message:
```
%ROUTING-BGP-3-MALFORM_UPDATE : Malformed UPDATE message received from neighbor 13.0.3.50 - message length 90 bytes, error flags 0x00000840, action taken "TreatAsWithdraw". Error details: "Error 0x00000800, Field "Attr-missing", Attribute 1 (Flags 0x00, Length 0), Data []"
```

## Replace BGP AS Path with Custom Values

### Configuration Example

To replace BGP AS path with custom values, perform the following tasks on a BGP router:

1. Configure route policy to replace AS path with null value:
```bash
Router(config)# route-policy aspath-none
Router(config-rpl)# replace as-path all none
Router(config-rpl)# end-policy
```

2. Apply route policy to BGP neighbor:
```bash
Router(config)# router bgp 65530
Router(config-bgp)# neighbor 111.0.0.1
Router(config-bgp-nbr)# address-family ipv4 unicast
Router(config-bgp-nbr-af)# route-policy aspath-none in
```

### Verification

Verify the replaced AS path:
```bash
Router# show bgp
Network          Next Hop          Metric LocPrf Weight Path
*> 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.1           0             0 i
```

## Use-defined Martian Check

The solution allows disabling the Martian check for these IP address prefixes:

**IPv4 address prefixes:**
- 0.0.0.0/8
- 127.0.0.0/8
- 224.0.0.0/4

**IPv6 address prefixes:**
- ::
- ::0002 - ::ffff
- ::ffff:a.b.c.d
- fe80:xxxx
- ffxx:xxxx
```
